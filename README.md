# Dual-Axis-Platform-Stabilization-using-PID-controllers
Design and implementation of a dual-axis platform stabilizer with the help of PID controllers to minimize the error between the platform’s orientation and ground level using purely analog circuitry.
A potentiometer with pendulum sensor is created and used to measure the platform's orientation and the PID controller provides a control signal depending on the error signal generated.
