The sensor is a custom made sensor. 
A Bourns 3590S precision potentiometer is used with a pendulum like weight attached to the shaft of the potentiometer.
The weight will be hanging downwards toward the earth's surface and the body of the potentiometer is to be attached to the platform. 
As the platform rotates the resistance of the potentiometer will vary giving varying voltages.
